## Pitstop Cafe

The Pitstop Cafe was the most magical, interesting yet challenging place Iâ€™ve had to work at. The cafe could hold about 50 customers at a time and there would only be 2 staff members assigned per shift, my shifts were often 6pm to 3am. The cafe was situated in a prime location of the Central Business District and was never empty. My duties included taking phone and online reservations, greeting customers, recommending board games according to their preference [party, mystery, action, strategy games], taking food orders, preparing drinks and desserts, serving the food, collecting payment, maintaining the cleanliness of the cafe, tabulating sales and closing. The other staff member was a cook who never left the kitchen. In my spare time I would educate myself and learn the 300 games available at the cafe and sometimes I would be requested to join a table as a filler player.

This was the job that taught me to multitask and had the greatest amount of responsibility I ever had. Although it was exhausting and terribly underpaying, it was the best work experience of my life to date.

Unfortunately, Pitstop Cafe had to close its doors in 2011.

## Satay Ria Restaurant

This was a waitressing job like any other, I took orders, submitted them, carried them out from the kitchen. I cleaned tables, I assigned seats and I patrolled the restaurant to refill glasses, rice bowls and replace cutlery.
