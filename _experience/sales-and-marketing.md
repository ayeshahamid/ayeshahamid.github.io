## Tupperware

While I was a Tupperware Demonstrator, I received product training and presentation training. My job had 3 stages:

Party Planning – Communicating with the host and arranging her party, encouraging guests to attend.

Party – Presenting the Tupperware core products and monthly specials, each presentation included referring guests to the catalogue, demonstrating the use of products, recommendation of regular use and care of products, video or cooking demonstration if applicable, and a quiz and answer sessions. (Each presentation was approximately an hour depending on the amount of time the host allocates for me)

Post-Party – Consolidating orders during the party, follow-up calls to guests over the weekend, entering party data (attendance/guest profiles/replacement orders) into Tupperware database, placing orders, receiving and checking orders and finally delivering orders to the host.

## MBM – Events

While I was working at MBM Marketing, I was promoting for CanTeen, a charity organization that supports children with cancer and children who have family members with cancer. I was posted to different locations every day to gather ongoing support for the organization. My job included setting up booths, displaying client information booklets, informing the public about the client’s services and encouraging sign-ups.
