## Inline Skating Coach

I was a skating instructor for a period of time before starting university. I taught beginner classes to children aged 7 to 9 and one class of 14 year olds for a few months. Aside from teaching skating foundations, I often had to help the children with their interaction between each other as some would fight over the colour of helmets and type of skates. I taught them safety measures and how to use and keep equipment properly. Often it was frustrating as children that age have very short attention spans and are quite daring. It was a challenging job to command the attention 30-60 students and to ensure order and safety in the class.

## Discovery Vacation Camps

I worked at a Science Camp for primary school children during their vacation, the camp was open to children aged 7-12, I was in charge of the 7 year olds. This was a weekly camp lasting 4 weeks of vacation, so some children were signed up for all 4 weeks, they would have a new class and study new topics each week. (Fire camp, Magnet camp, Plant camp and so on)

Although the job description was “Science Camp Leader” and I would be assisting a teacher with experiments, I was more of a babysitter. I started the day setting the tables for breakfast for the children, I had to feed some of the children and clean up after them. I would prepare the necessary materials for the experiments throughout the day and distribute learning materials to the class. Some days of the camp were dedicated to learning journeys so I had to ensure the safety of all the children during the trip and manage their behaviors in public. (I was attached to an elderly teacher of about 70 so she was unable to control the children, but I assume the other classes at the camp would have been easier to manage with younger teachers controlling them)

Each day also had a performance session where the children would plan and practice a skit or a dance they would perform at the end of the camp week. At the end of day, I was very weary but had to clean up the classrooms, pack the materials back, head to the store room to order materials the next day if required. (this was a very fun camp for the children it was all hands on experiments, about 8 experiments each day) Finally I would sit with the children at the gates of the school until their parents arrived.

I thoroughly loved this job because I like Science, I like children,  I like learning through experiments and I really wish I had attended such a camp as a child.
