## Urban Motifs Projects

This was a home and office renovation company that my friend had founded. I  operated the office entirely on my own, handling petty cash, issuing of invoices to clients, ordering materials and did stock-take (floor tiles/carpets/window panes/glass panels/doors).

Occasionally I would supervise the construction workers at various sites to ensure the working conditions were safe and they were managing their time effectively.

## Singapore Press Holdings

It was delight working for Singapore’s largest newspaper publication company. My role was a Customer Service Officer and I answered an average of 70 calls a day and up to 100 calls during promotion periods.

I answered inquiries about papers not being delivered, the wrong publication was delivered (there are 7 types of English papers daily and a variety of papers in Mandarin, Malay and Tamil Language) and replacement of paper delivery when the papers got wet from the rain or torn up by their pets. I had to liaise with the delivery department and call individual contractors for each suburb to order same-day replacement of newspapers. I also handled billing inquiries such as overdue payment or purchasing promotion packages.

## Courier Circle

This was my very first job when I was 14, my job was simple – answering phone calls and taking courier orders and collating receipts that the drivers bring back to me.
