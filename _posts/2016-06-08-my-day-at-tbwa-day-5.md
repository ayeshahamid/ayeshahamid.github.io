## Day 5

I still don't see any familiar faces on my walk to work hmm.

Today Tamsin's allowed me to sit beside her and run through a client brief and contact the necessary people for schedules, talent images, creative spreads and such. While everything makes sense to me I didn't know there were so many factors involved in an ad.

A complication we faced today was the "usage" of an image. So we had an ad from before and we're updating the copy and promotions but want the same image of the product. I learnt that usage includes a timeframe and a set of media platforms it can used for.

Okok for example,

> 1. Photo of Guy A.
> 
>    To use this image I must pay Guy A
> 
> 2. Famous Photographer photographs Guy A
> 
>    To use this image, I must pay Photographer & Guy A
> 
> 3. Famous Photographer photographs Guy A with a tattoo on his arm
> 
>    To use this image, I must pay Photographer, Guy A & Tattoo artist

And all this has its "usage" which is the lifespan of this image for use, so typically I will pay $XX for 1 year of use, across Print Platforms, or $XXX for 1 year of use, across Print, OOH (Out of Home) and Digital Platforms. While images of products often have 1 year usage, images with Talent (this means models basically) usually expire after 6months.

So the little pickle we had was the product image we wanted had usage til August, BUT it had a talent demonstrating the product, so that's expired. And to renew this usage or extend would cost a hell lot of money which would not be worth it, so we either find a new picture of do not include a picture in the ad. :(

How sad will that be seeing a bright ad in the papers.

Next thing I learnt, rather interesting is some marketing basics STP, taking the example of selling $5000 Beds/Mattresses

So we have first:

1. Segmentation  
   Where we group people who are likely to buy beds  
   - Old people with certain needs - reclining beds
   - Young couples/newly weds purchasing new homes/furniture
   - Families

2. Targeting  
   AB Men + Women 40-60
   We pick 40-60 and affluent people because our beds are $5000 and have special features, now I know you're wondering what AB is.

   Basically agencies classify people according to their wealth as such:  
   A. King/Queen  
   B. Dukes/Earls  
   C1. Upper Middleclass  
   C2. Lower Middleclass  
   D. ?  
   E. Living off benefits

   It's rather exaggerated, but by using AB, we mean we are targeting richie rich people.

3. Positioning  
   Half page ad in XYZ Magazine and GoldLife!
   This is where we pick the publications that our target (AB Men + Women 40-60) will likely read and come across our ad.
   You can also decide things like, a study shows rich people like blue things, so the ad will be printed with a blue background.

More estimates, MIs and job bags filled my afternoon. I ate wayyy too much for lunch and was just sitting uncomfortably for a long time.

Bonded with Harrison more today, he's into writing as well :D Shared a little about myself and how I get in the position. He says this will likely open many doors for me, here's hoping thats true !

Tamsin and Amanda were a meeting for a long long time, and I wasn't quite sure what to do with my time this afternoon, I educated myself through feedly but there's only so many articles I can read before my brain gets exhausted.

I finally decided to get up and talk to someone, well not just anyone, I can't just waltz up and talk to the seniors so I picked Christian, he's young and asian, just like me XD

Christian was slightly displaced over his current task as he hadn't received one like it before. We were chatting about Singapore, and why I don't want to go home.

Things are quite funny, I was just recounting my conversation with Amanda to Christian -

me: hi Amanda, haven't helped you today, is everything going smoothly?
A: I've missed you, I don't have anything for you, you don't have to stay you know, it's Friday, you can go out
me: what you mean leave the office?
A: yea sure, you can head out.

So I was whining to Christian how I would be just as bored if I just went home and hes wishing he was in my position.

Amanda strides over to interrupt us and says "I know what I said, but I need you nowwwww!

Awww. So I jump up to assist her, Hannah comes around and steals my line "Hey, have you got anything you need help with?"

!!!  
Noooo Hannah, that's my line, don't rob me please!

Eva's brought a puppy in today, just fyi, all dogs are puppies. It's one of those small brown toy breeds with really curly fur.

And that concludes week 1 interning at TBWA

Highlight: An announcement came for all staff to attend a Facebook training session. Tamsin simply brushed it off saying "I know how to post, that's all I need!"
